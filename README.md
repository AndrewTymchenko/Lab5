Lab5-A Simple Game 
====
Objective:
This repository creates a simple game that moves an '*' across a 2x8 LCD screen hooked up to the Geek Box. 
The '*' begins at the top left corner of the screen. 
By pushing button, the player moves the '*' to the bottom right of the board to win. 
Interrupts and the Timer_A subsystem were new ideas introduced in this lab. 

Details: 
A button library and LCD library were included from Lab4 to be successdul. 
B Functionality required button presses to be handled via interrupts. 
A Functionality required two mines in random positions on the board represented by an 'x'. 
The players must navigate around the mines or they will get a "Game Over". 

Game Over? Hit any button to reset.
